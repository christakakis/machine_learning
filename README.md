# Machine Learning
**Classification, Categorization, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.**

#### In this repo various techniques of Machine Learning are reproduced and applied on both numerical(.xlsx, .csv) and image data. 

### Briefly, the repo contains:

  • **(1) Supervised Learning - Classification.** Comparing different models on numerical data of financial indicators for businesses in order to classify them as bankrupt or not.
  
  • **(2) Computer Vision - Classification.** Implemenation of Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) technique for an image dataset (Mammals Classication).
  
  • **(3) CNN Architecture.** Comparing and seeking the best result of various convolutional neural network architectures for CIFAR-10 dataset, while trying different loss functions.
  
  • **(4) Unsupervised Learning – Clustering.** Develop and combine deep learning models / clustering techniques on Fashion-MNIST dataset.
  
  • **(5) NLTK Library – Sentence Generator & Classify Reviews.** Sentence creation from bigrams and trigrams generated by Project Gutenberg books. Classifier training to find positive and negative movie reviews.

This repository was initially created to store my personal python codes but also be available to others trying to build or understand something similar.
The codes contained in this repo are made specifically for a Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing course of my MSc program.
